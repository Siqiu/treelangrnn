steady continuous swimming for long duration is rarely observed in most fish species
instead individuals usually employ short bursts of activity followed by a brief inactive period where inertia allows them to glide along for a certain distance
this unsteady swimming pattern referred to as ‘burst-and-coast’ swimming has been hypothesized to yield energetic benefits and to bestow a competitive edge to species employing the technique
this sort of intermittent motion is not just limited to fish-swimming but is found in a variety of animal species
in addition to reducing energy expenditure the inactive phase of the motion has been attributed with stabilizing the sensory field enhancing the possibility of prey-detection and diminishing the wake-signature to avoid alerting potential prey and predators
unfortunately all of these advantages are usually accompanied by a reduction in average speed of the organism
early studies investigating the energetic benefits of intermittent swimming relied on simplified inviscid flow-dynamics
certain approaches have even represented fish bodies using prolate spheres NAME analysed video of free swimming cod and saithe and used simplified energetics models to surmise that the fish used burst-coast patterns that resulted in the most efficient locomotion
NAME and NAME used particle image velocimetry to study flow-patterns generated during burst-coast swimming
NAME investigated the dependence of coasting behaviour on changes in the body morphology
NAME demonstrated the existence of two distinct tail-beat modes for swimming carp which adopt burst-coast swimming for approximately NUM to NUM of their swimming time
apart from various experimental investigations burst-coast swimming has also been the subject of some numerical studies albeit using a-priori specified parameters for the burst-coast motion
in order to discover the best burst-and-coast swimming approach without having to resort to simplifying assumptions we couple high-fidelity simulations of self-propelled swimmers with evolutionary-optimization algorithms
the use of multi-objective optimization allows us to consider two important and potentially conflicting metrics namely the average speed and the cost of transport
these two quantities dictate overall performance for the majority of motile organisms and consequently determine their evolutionary fitness to pass on advantageous characteristics to future generations
analyzing flow-patterns generated by individuals that emerge as optimal solutions can provide invaluable insight regarding intermittent swimming modes which can help us improve the efficacy of underwater propulsion systems
furthermore we investigate the trade-off between speed and efficiency that fish experience when transitioning from the larval to the adult stage of their lives
this is essential for ascertaining the causal-effects that influence the evolution of the burst-coast pattern as certain studies have shown that the preference for passive coasting increases with age and hence with body size
the current work is distinct from previous numerical and analytical studies that have utilized optimization algorithms to examine self-propelled swimmers in that we study intermittent locomotion modes
moreover we consider two disparate performance metrics simultaneously both of which are critical for the survival of most organisms
from a computational viewpoint the modular approach used for coupling standalone applications in this study each of which is highly specialized for its own particular task allows for nearly effortless and extremely effective task-based parallelization of the optimization procedure
the parallelization is further enhanced by machine-learning based task-scheduling
